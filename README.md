# To Do List Web Application
## Using React Js

## INTRODUCTION
  In this project, I have developed a To=Do-List web application using famous frontend react.js library. Primary objective of this project is to gain a solid understanding in basic concepts such as functional components, JSX, CSS styles, click events, hooks, Props & props drilling, controlled inputs, Fetch API data and CRUD operations. 

## Project Structure
  In this project folder, package.json, package-lock.json, Readme.md files are there. In package.json, project's dependency packages which were installed from npm website, are mentioned with there versions. In src folder, number of functional components are present in which each component describe specific features in the application. In data folder, we have db.json file which created to store user data and used as database. CRUD operations are done with db.json file which achieved by using "json-server" package which is used to build fake api.
